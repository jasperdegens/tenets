# Dimension 6 — Delivery and tooling (Rules 11, 08)

- Is each commit one logical change, with refactors separated from behavior changes? (11.1)
- Does every commit pass the acceptance gate and revert cleanly on its own? (11.2)
- Is unfinished behavior unreachable — behind a flag or unwired — rather than half-shipped, and is
  that isolation deleted when the work completes? (11.2, 1.5)
- Are commit messages imperative and carrying the why, not a file list? (11.2)
- Is any metric being optimized as a target rather than read as a signal? (11.3)
- Does a production-relevant behavior change ship the signal to see it fail: a log with actionable
  context, a health state, or a metric? (11.4)
- Are expected failures logged where the boundary translates them, and invariant failures surfaced
  loudly? (11.4)
- Does normal work use documented repository-owned commands, with no undocumented global tools or ad
  hoc variants? (08)
- Are new dependencies, packages, root-config changes, or gate changes within explicit task scope or
  backed by a decision record? (7.8, 8.3)
- Are there local suppressions standing in for a central decision? (08)
- Does new enforcement prefer native tool capability over custom policy code? (08, 10.4)
- Are cache declarations and generated-state exclusions accurate and aligned across tools? (8.3)
- Do hooks stay cheap and scoped, never running integration or end-to-end work? (8.2)
- If work was split across agents or worktrees, were the write sets disjoint — or did two changes
  edit one file? (15.1)
- Are the convergence points this change touched append-only, generated, or singly owned? (15.2)
- Was the plan re-derived against what actually landed, rather than replayed against stale state?
  (15.4)
- Where a human eye is the check, is the evidence posted where the reviewer looks — never a local
  path — with the question it answers beside it, and failures shown the same way? (17.1)
- Does a visible change carry a screenshot of the result at the viewports it affects? (17.2)
- Does anything running in a live system, including every live push, carry the URL the reviewer
  can open? (17.3)
- Is anything that cannot run in the remote environment flagged in the plan and the report rather
  than deferred to a local machine? (17.4)
