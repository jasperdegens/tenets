# 01 Coding Philosophy

Functional-first, immutable, contract-driven code. Optimize for correctness, reviewability,
and agent legibility before speed.

## 1.1 Non-Negotiables

- Validate untrusted data at boundaries.
- Represent expected failure with `Result<T, E>` / `ResultAsync<T, E>`.
- Use `invariant()` only for impossible programmer-error states.
- Prefer immutable data: `const`, readonly inputs, spreads, non-mutating transforms.
- Keep modules deep: small public API, meaningful hidden implementation.
- Write behavioral tests before or alongside behavior changes.
- Document exported behavior and non-obvious decisions.

## 1.2 Design Order

1. **YAGNI:** no speculative extension points.
2. **KISS:** the simplest design that preserves the contract.
3. **DRY:** abstract after three real repetitions, or earlier only when Rule 1.6 earns the boundary.
4. **SOLID/principles:** only when they reduce real complexity.

Rule 10 governs larger architecture and tooling decisions.

## 1.3 Contracts Everywhere

Every public function, package boundary, adapter boundary, and workflow step has a contract:
**preconditions** (schema parse, type signature, or invariant), **postconditions** (returned values,
typed errors, persisted state, side effects, immutability promises), and **invariants** (facts that
stay true after success). Enforce contracts at both ends where cheap (Rule 02.2, the airlock).

Schemas own untrusted runtime boundaries; derive static types from the schema so runtime and
compile-time contracts cannot drift.

## 1.4 Deep and Legible Code

Before implementing, name the boundary, public API, inputs, outputs, error cases, invariants, tests,
and docs to update; non-trivial work uses the implementation-plan template the project guide names.

Make invalid states unrepresentable: discriminated unions, branded IDs, schemas, narrow public
types. Export a purpose-built DTO, not the internal domain model. Prefer predictable structure over
cleverness — readers should find validation, core logic, tests, and docs without guessing.

## 1.5 Clean Deletion

Replacing code removes the old path completely unless a migration period is explicitly required. No
`V2` names, deprecated shadows, speculative modules, or README stubs unless the task requires them.
Scaffold placeholders exist only before behavior does, and must say they are placeholders.

## 1.6 Earning an Abstraction

Introduce a port, adapter, or interface only when the decision behind it is volatile (Rule 3.6),
when a real second implementation exists (Rule 7.10), or when a test double must stand in for an
external system at that seam. One production implementation plus a fake earns the port; a
hypothetical second one does not. Keep it light: only the operations callers invoke, in the domain's
vocabulary, no provider types crossing it (Rule 10.5), proven by one contract test (Rule 4.4).
Collapse an interface that mirrors its only implementation method for method, and split a shared
helper that grows flags to serve divergent callers — duplication is cheaper than the wrong
abstraction.
