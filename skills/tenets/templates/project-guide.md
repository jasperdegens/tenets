# Project guide (template)

The single file translating the generic engineering rules (the `tenets` skill) into this
project. Rules are never edited per project, and ecosystem mechanisms belong to the language profile
the skill loads; every project-specific fact, path, command, and deviation lives here.

**How to populate:** replace each comment block with real content and delete the comment. Keep every
heading, even when a section is one line — rules cite these sections, and an agent treats a missing
heading as an unanswered deferral. Keep the populated guide under ~600 words: it is read far more
often than any rule, so every sentence must earn always-on context. Write facts an agent cannot
infer from code or config; never restate what a README or the rules already say.

## Stack

<!-- WHAT: runtime(s) and versions, language/compiler version, framework(s), package manager,
     deployment platform, and the language profile in use (`tenets.json` `profile`). One bullet
     each.
     WHY: Rule 08 sends agents here when reference examples name a different stack; agents also use
     this to resolve version-sensitive behavior (Rule 10.1) against the right docs.
     QUALITY BAR: an agent reading only this section knows which documentation set to trust.
     EXAMPLE: "Bun (package manager only) — application code runs on Node.js 24; no Bun APIs." -->

## Commands

<!-- WHAT: one table (Command | Use) covering setup (including the one command that makes a new
     worktree or fresh clone runnable, Rule 18.4), iteration/dev, the full acceptance gate,
     format/lint fixes, and any expensive or live commands — explicitly marked as such.
     WHY: Rules 08, 4.8, 9.2, and 18.4 defer here; Rule 11.2's "green commit" means this table's
     gate passes. Agents must never guess whether a command is cheap iteration or a live call.
     QUALITY BAR: the gate command is unambiguous, and nothing requires undocumented flags. -->

| Command | Use |
| ------- | --- |
|         |     |

## Workspace map

<!-- WHAT: the package namespace (Rule 7.1); one row per workspace with its family
     (app/package/lib) and one-line responsibility; the permitted dependency directions and the
     tool that enforces them (Rule 7.2). If directory names differ from the rule vocabulary
     (apps/packages/libs), state the mapping here. Name any convergence points — registries,
     generated files, migration sequences — and who owns them (Rule 15.2).
     WHY: this is how an agent decides where new code lives and what it may import, and where
     concurrent work will collide.
     QUALITY BAR: every workspace appears; an agent can place a new module without asking. -->

## Shared primitives

<!-- WHAT: where each rule primitive lives — Result/ResultAsync -> <package>,
     invariant + InvariantError -> <package>, boundary schema library (Rule 2.1) -> <package>.
     The API names are fixed by the language profile (Rule 7.6); only locations are configurable
     here.
     Note any workspace that cannot use them (e.g. a publishable package that must stay
     dependency-free) and what it does instead.
     QUALITY BAR: an agent writing a failing function knows the exact import path. -->

## Tests

<!-- WHAT: runner identity; filename suffix per scope (unit/integration/live/e2e); where tests
     live; how selection works (affected-only vs full); which command runs which scope.
     WHY: Rules 4.1, 4.6, and 4.8 defer here.
     QUALITY BAR: an agent can name a new test file correctly and run exactly its scope. -->

## Documentation map

<!-- WHAT: locations for the preamble schema (Rule 5.1) and its required shape; the three templates
     (implementation plan, package README, learning entry); topic pages; architecture notes;
     glossary; decision records/ADRs; the learnings inbox directory.
     WHY: Rules 1.4, 5.4, 5.5, and 6.1 defer here; a missing location silently breaks the
     capture-and-curate loop.
     QUALITY BAR: every documentation kind the rules mention resolves to exactly one path. -->

## Vocabulary

<!-- WHAT: where the glossary lives (Rule 7.9), plus any terms with one canonical project meaning
     that agents would otherwise guess at.
     QUALITY BAR: no concept two workspaces share is defined only in someone's head. -->

## Data and runtime

<!-- WHAT: the concrete stores per Rule 12.2 (system of record, KV/cache, analytics, blob) and
     which workspace owns which tables; the serverless platform and its hard limits — timeout,
     memory, payload, concurrency (Rule 13); the caching layers available and the invalidation
     tooling (Rule 13.3); environment configuration (Rule 18) — where the contracts and the
     example file live, the one source of local values (a secret-manager or platform pull, or a
     copy from the main checkout), where each remote environment (agent sessions, CI, preview,
     production) gets its variables and which it lacks, and how parallel worktrees get their own
     ports, databases, and container names.
     QUALITY BAR: an agent choosing where data lives, or checking what a function may not do,
     finds the answer here — including "no store yet" stated explicitly — and an agent in a new
     worktree or a cloud session knows where its variables come from. -->

## Change delivery

<!-- WHAT: branching model, and whether merges squash so the pull request body becomes the merged
     commit's message (Rule 16.5); branch-name prefixes when they differ from Rule 16.4's defaults;
     flag/isolation conventions for unfinished work (Rule 11.2); commit message conventions beyond
     Rule 11.2's defaults; the observability tooling — logger, metrics, health conventions and the
     correlation-id mechanism (Rules 11.4, 13.6); the verification surfaces (Rule 17) —
     preview-deployment platform and its URL pattern, staging and production URLs, the screenshot
     tool, and where evidence is posted (write-up, PR comment, session).
     QUALITY BAR: an agent shipping a production-relevant change knows which logger to import and
     can hand a reviewer a URL and a screenshot without asking where they come from. -->

## Rule addenda and recorded deviations

<!-- WHAT: the only place project-specific exceptions live. One bullet per deviation, citing the
     rule anchor and the reason — e.g. "7.2: packages may also depend on libs (never published)" or
     "2.3: the X SDK throws; translated once in adapters/x.ts".
     WHY: rules stay unedited; an undocumented deviation reads as a violation in review (Rule 9.4).
     Keep the section present even when empty — an explicit "none" beats an ambiguous absence. -->
